#An Advice Regarding Sickness & Difficulty, Especially in Relation to Magic

##Part One: Taqwā

<br/>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>In the name of Allāh, The Most Merciful, The Bestower of Mercy</strong></p>All praise is due to Allāh alone. We praise Him, we seek His help, and we ask for His forgiveness. Whomsoever Allāh guides, there is none who can misguide him, and whomsoever Allāh misguides, there is none who can guide him. I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allāh, alone and with no partner; and I bear witness that Muhammad – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – is Allāh’s slave and final messenger.
To continue, Allāh has made giving sincere advice obligatory for every Muslim. Allāh The Exalted said:
> **"By time, Indeed, mankind is in loss, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds and advise each other to truth and advise each other to patience."**
And His Messenger – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said:
>_"The religion is [giving] sincere advice."_ The companions replied: "To whom, O Messenger of Allāh?" He said – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him, _"To Allāh, His Book, His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and the general people."_
The best general advice that can be given to anyone is the advice to have _taqwā_ of Allāh. Taqwā is to put a barrier between yourself and between Allāh’s anger by doing everything that Allāh orders you to do and keeping away from everything which Allāh forbids you, whilst keeping the correct intention, and making sure that the action is in accordance with the _sunnah_ of the Messenger of Allāh (may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him). 
There is no doubt that taqwā is the key to success in this world and the hereafter. Allāh The Exalted said:
> **"And take provisions [for your journey], but indeed, the best provision is taqwā. And fear Me, O you of understanding."**
Taqwā is also the key to knowledge, as Allāh said:

>**"And have taqwā of Allāh and Allāh teaches you".**

Just as taqwā is a way out of every problem, as Allāh said: 

>**"And whoever has taqwā of Allāh - He will make for him a way out [from every difficulty], and provide for him from [sources] he never could imagine. And whoever relies upon Allāh - then He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allāh will accomplish His purpose. Allāh has already set for everything a [decreed] extent."**
