#An Advice Regarding Sickness & Difficulty, Especially in Relation to Magic

This is a long piece which I wrote to one of my first ruqyah patients. I think it is - by the grace of Allāh - beneficial for any person experiencing hardship or difficulty in their lives, especially due to sickness, and even more so when that sickness is caused by the jinn, magic & the evil eye.

I've broken it down into a number of sections (they're supposed to be read in order):

1. [The Importance of Taqwā](/advice/1)
2. [Knowledge & Action](/advice/2)
3. [What Every Sick Muslim Needs to Know](/advice/3)
4. [Du'a & Its Etiquettes](/advice/4)
5. [Reliance & Medicine](/advice/5)
6. [The Prayer](/advice/6)
7. [Plots of the Shaytān](/advice/7)
8. [Magic & Magicians](/advice/8)
