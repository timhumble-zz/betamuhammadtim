#Information for Ruqyah Patients

This document - *in shā' Allāh* - is designed to provide important information for patients who are asking for *ruqyah* to be performed. 

There is a clinic which I run every Tuesday in Newcastle-upon-Tyne for ruqyah patients. As a rule, I don't travel for the purpose of ruqyah, so patients have to come to Newcastle.

This document is not yet complete, but for the time being, here are a few points:

* Prepare yourself by repenting to Allāh and purifying your heart. [This advice may help](/advice).
* Stick to your regular [adhkaar](/protectys).
* Follow the [7 day ruqyah programme](/7dayrd), and repeat it if necessary.
* Try to recite the Qur'an yourself, especially [al-Faatihah](http://quran.com/1), [al-Baqarah](http://quran.com/2), [Aayat-ul-Kursi](http://quran.com/2/255), [the last two aayaat from al-Baqarah](http://quran.com/2/285-286), [al-Ikhlaas](http://quran.com/112), [al-Falaq](http://quran.com/113), and [an-Naas](http://quran.com/114). Blow into your hands and wipe over yourself, if you are able.
*  Listen to ruqyah audio, preferrably with headphones, such as the audio [here](http://quranaudiodownload.com/audio/ruqyah/Sheikh_Ahmed_Bin_Ali_Al-Ajmy_Ruqya.mp3), and [here](http://youtu.be/0O0Q_-oc1rU).

When you come to the ruqyah clinic, please bear in mind the following:

* Be punctual
* Respect the privacy and confidentiality of any other patients that you may meet
* Women - come in full hijaab, including jilbaab/'abaya, covering from the top of your head to the tip of your toe. We would prefer you to also cover your face and hands.
* Women - bring a [mahram](http://islamqa.com/en/ref/137095/mahram) with you. If you cannot bring a mahram with you, for a legitimate reason, such as the case of some revert sisters who don't have a mahram, then you must bring another reliable sister with you to support you - we will not perform ruqyah upon you alone.
