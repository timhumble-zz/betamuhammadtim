#Information for Ruqyah Patients

This document - *in shā' Allāh* - is designed to provide important information for patients who are asking for *ruqyah* to be performed. 

There is a clinic which I run every Tuesday evening in Newcastle-upon-Tyne for ruqyah patients. As a rule, I don't travel for the purpose of ruqyah, so patients have to come to Newcastle, and there are currently no alternate days or times available. Bookings are taken via brother Basak, who is my ruqyah partner. His number is given out on request to people who ask for appointments.

This document is not yet complete, but for the time being, here are a few points:

* Prepare yourself by repenting to Allāh and purifying your heart. [This advice may help](/advice).
* Stick to your regular [adhkaar](/protectys).
* Follow the [7 day ruqyah programme](/7dayrd), and repeat it if necessary.
* Try to recite the Qur'an yourself, especially [al-Faatihah](http://quran.com/1), [al-Baqarah](http://quran.com/2), [Aayat-ul-Kursi](http://quran.com/2/255), [the last two aayaat from al-Baqarah](http://quran.com/2/285-286), [al-Ikhlaas](http://quran.com/112), [al-Falaq](http://quran.com/113), and [an-Naas](http://quran.com/114). Blow into your hands and wipe over yourself, if you are able.
*  Listen to ruqyah audio, preferrably with headphones, such as the audio [here](http://quranaudiodownload.com/audio/ruqyah/Sheikh_Ahmed_Bin_Ali_Al-Ajmy_Ruqya.mp3), and [here](http://youtu.be/0O0Q_-oc1rU).
*  The clinic for most people is an hour a week. This is not enough, except for those upon whom Allāh bestows His mercy. It is designed simply to monitor you and to guide you to a successful conclusion, with the help of Allāh. Self help is a critical part of this, as is working hard to do good deeds and reduce sins.

When you come to the ruqyah clinic, please bear in mind the following:

* Be punctual.
* Switch off your mobile phones.
* Do not talk or distract anyone during the ruqyah session, unless there is an urgent need to do so.
* Respect the privacy and confidentiality of any other patients that you may meet. We do try to avoid patients meeting each other, but occaisionally this is unavoidable.
*  Our payment and donation policy is very clear: we do not accept payment or *hadiyyah* for ruqyah. However, we do have a charity which we have established for a wide range of Islamic aims, and you can donate to the charity, which myself and Basak are legally prohibited from benefitting from. We would prefer that this donation is made anonymously, and will post online donation details soon in shaa' Allāh. **Please note that donations regardless of how much will not get a patient any more ruqyah, and not donating will not get a patient any less ruqyah**.
* **Women (including relatives/friends who attend):** come in full hijaab, including jilbaab/'abaya, covering from the top of your head, with no hair showing, to the tip of your toe, including your feet. We would prefer you to also cover your face and hands. Do not wear perfume or make-up, and do not come with jewellery or other adornments on display.  **We reserve the right to refuse an appointment to a patient who does not comply with these rules, or who brings friends/relatives who do not comply.**
* **Women:** bring a [mahram](http://islamqa.com/en/ref/137095/mahram) with you. If you cannot bring a mahram with you for a legitimate reason, such as the case of some revert sisters who don't have a mahram, then you must bring another reliable sister with you who is able and confident enough to support you - we will not perform ruqyah upon you alone. In rare cases where you cannot bring another sister, please inform the brother who books appointments, and we will advise you whether we are able to accommodate.
