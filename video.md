#Video Lectures

A lot of the lectures that I do end up on YouTube. 

Here are a selection of the lectures that I think are the most beneficial and important. More will be added when I have time to review them, in shaa' Allāh:

* [How To Protect Yourself From Magic, Evil Eye & The Jinn](http://youtu.be/-6J8me0RjYY)

* [Abracadabra: The Sinister World of Magic](http://youtu.be/an0BUey2eKM)

* [Al-Qur'an: The Ultimate Cure](http://youtu.be/p1zLqbVk9EE)

* [Du'a: The Weapon of the Believer](http://youtu.be/UYgBOpHtqzE)

In the future, and with the permission of Allāh, I hope to be able to post corrections to any mistakes here as well. Eventually, the idea is to incorporate corrections into the videos themselves.
