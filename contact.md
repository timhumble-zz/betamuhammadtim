#Contact Me

One of the things I've tried to do of late is to streamline the way people contact me. For this reason, I've deleted my Facebook account, and I no longer use my old phone number on a regular basis. 

Instead, I'm trying to focus upon using email for the majority of people who need to get in touch. Email means that I no longer have to worry about missed calls, and it's harder to forget to reply. They're as instant as text messages, and not dependant on someone having my phone number. They're also easy to track and prioritise.

My email is muhammadtim, followed by the email 'at' sign, followed by gmail.com. This email is for things that are personal, as well as things related to Islam, including ruqyah, questions, lectures, etc.

**PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:**

* If you want to request me to perform ruqyah, you must [read this first](/ruqyah). Note that I only perform ruqyah on the specific day mentioned in the link and I only perform it in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Requests which fall outside of this will likely be refused.
* Please do not include the word **urgent** or any of its synonyms in the subject line, and do not mark the email as important. Every ruqyah case is urgent, and many Islamic questions are urgent, so please do not presume you have more right than the existing people who are waiting for answers.
* I don't recommend other raaqis except those whom I work with on a regular basis, namely Abu Ibraaheem in Birmingham. That doesn't mean that there aren't other brothers - there are many, and some of them I am very close to - but I've had my fingers burnt too many times. There are many groups who can find you a raaqi in your area, including [Ruqya Support](http://ruqyasupport.com/), [The Ruqyah Room](https://en-gb.facebook.com/TheRuqyaRoom), and others. I can't vouch for everyone whom they recommend, I can only recommend you to watch [my videos](/video) which include discussions about what to be wary of.
* I am extremely busy, and it can often take me 2-4 weeks to respond to an email. Please do not send follow up emails asking why I haven't responded. If you haven't received a response after 4 weeks, you're welcome to chase it up.  

I have a separate work email, given out on request, for business related queries.
