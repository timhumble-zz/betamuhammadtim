#Contact Me

One of the things I've tried to do of late is to streamline the way people contact me. For this reason, I've deleted my Facebook account, and I no longer use my old phone number on a regular basis. 

Instead, I'm trying to focus upon using email for the majority of people who need to get in touch. Email means that I no longer have to worry about missed calls, and it's harder to forget to reply. They're as instant as text messages, and not dependant on someone having my phone number. They're also easy to track and prioritise.

My email is muhammadtim, followed by the email 'at' sign, followed by gmail.com. This email is for things that are personal, as well as things related to Islam, including ruqyah, questions, lectures, etc.

I have a separate work email, given out on request, for business related queries.

You can also follow me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/muhammadtim).
